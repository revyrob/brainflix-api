# 👩‍💻 Brainflix  
Personnel portfolio, displaying my projects and a summary of myself.  Built with React and React-dom.  I enjoyed learning P5 to create the following matrix affect with the letters in my name.  I also created a looping flicker with my name.  I did have a bit of problem with resetting the banner when the page was resized but I did solve it.  I used MUI, Framer-motion, Formik, and Toastify libraries.  I used SASS for the styling and stuck to the BEM convention.

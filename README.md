# 👩‍💻 Brainflix  
Brainflix was my first full stack project which I created with React, Express, and Axios.  We created endpoints to Create, Read, and Delete.  A user can upload a photo with a title and a description.  A user can add comments to the new posts created.  
Responsive in mobile, tablet, and desktop.
